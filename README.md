I developed an order tracking web application using Java Spring Boot and threads. This project includes admin, producer, and customer pages. Changes made by customers and producers on products are dynamically updated, and stock levels are adjusted accordingly. The admin has a specific function, allowing them to view logs.

Technologies: java threads, spring boot, spring rest, hibernate, thymeleaf, mysql, javascript
